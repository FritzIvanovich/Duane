japan_ec012af7		What should I do?	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	573
japan_565620a9		I have no idea where I am and I didn't make any progress with my dew assignment either.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	574
japan_40e2071f		I see some mountains in the distance.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	575
japan_a2fd627b		Maybe I can find someone there who can tell me where exactly this is.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	576
japan_0f04eaf2		There's also a forest close by.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	577
japan_159da76a		Maybe I should try my luck there?	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	578
japan_c3def765		Given the circumstances, the most MLG decision would be...	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	579
japan_da5dad34	d	It's a shot in the dark whatever I pick, so I might as well try the forest.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	586
japan_9e72244c		And so Duane went to the forest in search of someone who could explain this predicament to him.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	592
japan_f69b184e		Chances to find someone were slim, but he had to do something.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	593
japan_62ff1170	d	Maaan, it was further away than I thought.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	594
japan_c43015cc	d	So this is it.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	599
japan_ec8a5fdf	d	There's stairs here, so there must be some kind of civilisation around here.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	600
japan_6f8b74f5		Duane wandered the forest in search of other people.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	601

japan_f9d86b94	d	But I hated the smell of seawater and now I'm stuck.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	608
japan_1e7be9a7	d	Running around wherever the hell without any clue where to go to.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	609
japan_e94e8f7c	d	Like some goddamned casual.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	610
japan_37489f85		As Duane walks around aimlessly, cursing his fate he spots something in the distance.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	611
japan_05dbc29f	d	Wait, what's that?	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	612

japan_72421745	d	I must find out where I am, so I gotta go after her!	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	632
japan_842ef340		Duane chased after the mysterious girl with all his might.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	638
japan_d31476eb		Even though he wasn't a slow runner, he had no hopes of catching up to her.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	639
japan_c47d67a7	d	Fuck!	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	641
japan_0e66c486	d	She's just too fast.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	642
japan_fa0e2f39		Due to Duane's MLG quickscoper eyes, he managed to follow her movements for a while.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	644
japan_e1d6add1		But it just wasn't possible for him to keep it up for long.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	645
japan_b398e3c6		He eventually lost her when he reached a mountain area.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	646

mountain_89cad070		I remember those old Kung Fu movies.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	670
mountain_f3cb6813		They often took place in a mountaineous area which had a shrine.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	671
mountain_4a2e1af5		Is it possible for one to be located here?	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	672
mountain_bebc7570		Considering there was this girl here, there must be some place for people to stay at.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	675
mountain_a8da32b1		It can't be she wanders around here by herself.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	676
mountain_e0a5f2ed		Especially with that fancy getup of hers.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	677
mountain_dc308260	d	Guess I just gotta keep looking for something.	/home/stefan/bin/script.rpyc	679
